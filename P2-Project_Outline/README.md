# Project Overview
In 1-2 paragraphs, provide an “elevator pitch” for your project. This should be a high-level 
overview of your idea, in non-technical language. What will your app do? What might users 
find useful about it? Where did the idea come from?
As a person with a personal slogan of “Getting Better All Day, Everyday”, I self-rate 
and try to do better in my life. I haven’t spoken to my tech mentor in quite some time,
and feel like with busy lives we could connect through an app whenever there’s time as 
opposed to forever trying to talk. 
This app will allow other people to find a mentor and do the same thing.


## Assignment Description
[Project Outline Assignment](https://education.launchcode.org/liftoff/modules/assignments/project-outline)

## Features
List 3-5 features that you will implement in your project. Each feature should have a name and a 1-2 sentence description. Here are a few examples for a blog application:
*	User login/Sign Up: Users will be able to create accounts and log in to the application. Each user will have a profile page.
*	2 User Levels: Mentors & Mentees (focusing on Mentees for now)
*	View posts of requests

## Technologies
What languages and technologies will you use to build your application? For example, for the Blogz application from Unit 2, the technologies would be:
*	Java 
*	JavaScript 
*	HTML/CSS 
*	Bootstrap

## What I'll Have to Learn
I have an understanding of the HTML5/CSS3, but would like to delve further into it and
perhaps to make the site more interactive, I may incorporate it, after investigation, 
Javascript. Furthermore, for better appearance, Bootstrap would be a technology that 
will be further investigated.
